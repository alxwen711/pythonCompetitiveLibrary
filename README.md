# Python Competitive Library
This is a repository containing useful Python files for competitive programming. 

# How to Use
The files are separated into four main folders:

- [**Algorithms**](./algorithms) for implementation of DFS/BFS, binary/ternary search, dynamic programming, computational math problems, and other problem solving procedures.

- [**Data Structures**](https://github.com/alxwen711/pythonCompetitiveLibrary/tree/main/data%20structures) for implementation of trees, graphs, hashmaps, stacks, queues, heaps, and other more complex structures.

- [**Utility**](./utility) for code that does not fit into one of the other two catagories. This can include input shorthands inserted at the beginning of any file for efficiency purpose, testcase generators, or templates for creating new algorithm/data structure files. One example are shorthand functions to make processing input easier found in [baseTemplate.py](./templates/baseTemplate.py).

- [**Example Uses**](./exampleuses) for using the above algorithm/data structure templates in actual code for programming contests. Each solution file begins with the programming question it is for as well as the methods from this library used.

If you would like to add/edit/contribute to this library, useful guidelines can be found in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/alxwen711/pythonCompetitiveLibrary/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

# Requesting New Files

Currently I have a [**Discussion Thread**](https://github.com/alxwen711/pythonCompetitiveLibrary/discussions/2) set up to keep track of future algorithms/data structures/other files I plan to implement into this library.

Alternatively you can also create an [Issue](https://github.com/alxwen711/pythonCompetitiveLibrary/issues) and tag it accordingly for new files you would like to see added or other feedback.
