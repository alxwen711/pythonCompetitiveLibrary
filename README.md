# Python Competitive Library
This is a repository containing useful Python files for competitive programming. 

# How to Use
The files are separated into three main folders:

- **Algorithms** for implementation of DFS/BFS, binary/ternary search, dynamic programming, computational math problems, and other problem solving procedures.

- **Data Structures** for implementation of trees, graphs, hashmaps, stacks, queues, heaps, and other more complex structures.

- **Templates** for basic code you would insert at the beginning of any file for competitive programming. One example are shorthand functions to make processing input easier found in [baseTemplate.py](./templates/baseTemplate.py).


# Contributing
This is a relatively new project I've began so all contributions are greatly appreciated. For any documentation edits (in Python files or README) simply create a pull request and I'll review it as soon as I can. 

If you want to add a new algorithm or data structure file then use the format given in [newAlgorithm.py](./contributing/algorithm.py) by writing your own code below the intial multiline comment. For the multiline comment replace all square brackets with the appropriate information; everything else there is optional. Testfiles for quality assurance are also appreciated and a template for creating them is found in [algorithmTest.py](./contributing/algorithmTest.py). 

If you are creating a new template file, newAlgorithm.py is unnecessary. Refer to [baseTemplate.py](./implementation/baseTemplate.py) as an example.

Keep in mind that for this project, the goal for each Python file is for it to be:

- Easy to understand
- Easy to modify for specific problems
- Practical for use in competition

I will typically review pull requests around 2-4 UTC daily. This is because I do not want to be merging while a CodeForces/CodeChef contest is occuring, and they do not occur at this time. 

If I have not responded to a PR after two weeks without reason then and ONLY then you can follow [this guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12686545/how-to-leave-a-message-for-a-github-com-user) to privately message me. For obvious reasons, please do not abuse the above.
