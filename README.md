# Python Competitive Library
This is a repository containing useful Python files for competitive programming. 

# How to Use
The files are separated into four main folders:

- [**Algorithms**](./algorithms) for implementation of DFS/BFS, binary/ternary search, dynamic programming, computational math problems, and other problem solving procedures.

- [**Data Structures**](https://github.com/alxwen711/pythonCompetitiveLibrary/tree/main/data%20structures) for implementation of trees, graphs, hashmaps, stacks, queues, heaps, and other more complex structures.

- [**Utility**](./utility) for code that does not fit into one of the other two catagories. This can include input shorthands inserted at the beginning of any file for efficiency purpose, testcase generators, or templates for creating new algorithm/data structure files. One example are shorthand functions to make processing input easier found in [baseTemplate.py](./templates/baseTemplate.py).

- [**Example Uses**](./exampleuses) for using the above algorithm/data structure templates in actual code for programming contests. Each solution file begins with the programming question it is for as well as the methods from this library used.

# Contributing

This is a relatively new project I've began so all contributions are greatly appreciated. Before contributing please read the [Style Guide](./docs/styleguide.md) for recommended code guidelines. Asides from these there isn't any other requirements other than making the code easy to use and understand.

For creating a new algorithm or data structure file a template exists in [algorithmTemplate.py](./utility/algorithmTemplate.py). For the multiline comment replace all square brackets with the appropriate information; everything else there is optional. Testfiles for quality assurance are also appreciated and a template for creating them is found in [algorithmTemplateTests.py](./utility/algorithmTemplateTests.py).

Once you have made additions in the form of code or documentation, submit a pull request and I will typically review it around 2-4 UTC daily. This is because I do not want to be merging while a CodeForces/CodeChef contest is occurring, and they do not occur at this time. 

If I have not responded to a PR after two weeks without reason then and ONLY then you can follow [this guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12686545/how-to-leave-a-message-for-a-github-com-user) to privately message me. For obvious reasons, please do not abuse the above. 

# Requesting New Files

There is currently a [**Discussion Thread**](https://github.com/alxwen711/pythonCompetitiveLibrary/discussions/2) detailing future algorithms/data structures/other files I plan to implement into this library.

Alternatively you can also create an [Issue](https://github.com/alxwen711/pythonCompetitiveLibrary/issues) and tag it accordingly for new files you would like to see added.
